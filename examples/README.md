# Azure IoT Hub Examples #

This document describes the example applications provided with the [AzureIoTHub library](../README.md).

## Messages example ##

The example:
- connects the device to Azure IoT Hub using the provided Device Connection String
- enables cloud-to-device messages functionality
- logs all messages received from the cloud
- periodically (every 10 seconds) sends a message to the cloud. The message contains an integer value and the current timestamp. The value increases by 1 with every sending, it restarts from 1 every time when the example is restarted.

Source code: [Messages.agent.nut](./Messages.agent.nut)

See [Messages Example Setup and Run](#messages-example-setup-and-run).

## Twins Example ##

This example:
- automatically registers the device (if not registered yet) using the provided Registry Connection String
- connects the device to Azure IoT Hub using an automatically obtained Device Connection String
- enables Twin functionality
- retrieves the Twin's properties (both - Desired and Reported) from the cloud and logs them
- logs all Desired properties received from the cloud, reads the value of the Desired property "test" and sends it back to the cloud as a Reported property

Source code: [Twins.agent.nut](./Twins.agent.nut)

See [Twins Example Setup and Run](#twins-example-setup-and-run).

## Direct Methods Example ##

This example:
- automatically registers the device (if not registered yet) using the provided Registry Connection String
- connects the device to Azure IoT Hub using an automatically obtained Device Connection String
- enables Direct Methods functionality
- logs all Direct Method calls received from the cloud, always responds success

Source code: [DirectMethods.agent.nut](./DirectMethods.agent.nut)

See [Direct Methods Example Setup and Run](#direct-methods-example-setup-and-run).
